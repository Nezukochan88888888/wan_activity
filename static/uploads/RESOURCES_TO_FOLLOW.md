# 🎮 **Game Development → Android Studio (Better for final app build)**

Android Studio is better **only for the Android part** of game development:

### You use Android Studio to:

- Export your Godot / Unity / Flutter game to Android
    
- Test your game on Android emulators
    
- Package your game into an APK / AAB
    
- Handle device compatibility
    
- Publish to the Play Store
    

It is **not** where you design or code the game itself.

### You design the game in:

- Godot
    
- Unity
    
- Unreal Engine
    
- Flutter with Flame engine
    
- HTML5 game engines (Phaser.js, etc.)
    

Then Android Studio is the **final step** to turn it into an Android app.








# 🌐 **Web Development → Visual Studio Code (VS Code stands out)**

VS Code is the best for all web-related development:

- React
    
- Node.js
    
- Express
    
- Tailwind
    
- Next.js
    
- HTML/CSS/JS
    
- Cloudinary integration
    
- Backend servers (Railway, Render)
    
- API development
    
- Web games using JavaScript
    

VS Code is **faster**, **lighter**, and **better for coding**.
